CONSOLE MESSAGE: [blocked] The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/site-isolation/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-css.html requested insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/style.css. This content was blocked and must be served over HTTPS.

This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure style sheet. We should trigger a mixed content callback because an active network attacker can use CSS3 to breach the confidentiality of the HTTPS security origin.
